# Kaggle Machine Learning Projects
## This repository contains following projects

#### 1] House Price Prediction (Oct 2025 - Nov 2025)
##### This dataset includes home sales prices in King County, including Seattle. It also includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015, and our mission is to build machine learning models that can predict home prices.

#### 2] Kannada Mnist (Jan 2026 - Jan 2026)
##### This project involves classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the Kannada language. Using a dataset of 60,000 training images, the goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) or other classification models that can accurately identify these unique numerical characters.

#### 3] Predicting Heart Disease (Feb 2026 - Feb 2026)
##### The goal of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. It focuses on binary classification and analyzing key health indicators to provide early diagnostic insights.

## This repository will demonstrate following skills

#### 1] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 2] Data Cleaning / Missing value processing

#### 3] Data Augmentation / Transformation

#### 4] Feature Selection and Feature Engineering

#### 5] Machine Learning models including Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Logistic regression, Descision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso & Ridge regression, ensemble (voting, boosting, stacking, blending, bagging), ETC to avoid overfitting
    
#### 6] Compared the performance using various accuracy metrics.
