# Kaggle Machine Learning Projects
## This repository contains following projects

#### 1] House Price Prediction (Jan 2026 - Jan 2026)
##### This dataset includes home sales prices in King County, including Seattle. It also includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015, and our mission is to build machine learning models that can predict home prices.

## This repository will demonstrate following skills

#### 1] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 2] Data Cleaning / Missing value processing

#### 3] Data Augmentation / Transformation

#### 4] Feature Selection and Feature Engineering

#### 5] Machine Learning models including Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Logistic regression, Descision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso & Ridge regression, ensemble (voting, boosting, stacking, blending, bagging), ETC to avoid overfitting
    
#### 6] Compared the performance using various accuracy metrics.
